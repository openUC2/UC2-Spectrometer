# openUC2 *Spectrometer*
---

Welcome to the openUC2 Spectrometer repository. This guide will assist you in constructing and setting up a simple spectrometer, a fundamental tool in the field of spectroscopy.

## Bill of Material

The following table lists all components needed to assemble the spectrometer, including 3D printing files. For 3D printing, we recommend using a Prusa i3 MK3 with PLA Prusament (Galaxy Black), at specified layer height and infill settings.

# Theoretical Background: Spectroscopy

Spectroscopy is the scientific study of the interaction between light and matter. It involves analyzing how light is absorbed, emitted, or scattered by different materials. This field is pivotal in understanding the properties of both light and matter.

**Key Concepts in Spectroscopy:**

- **Visible Spectrum**: The portion of the electromagnetic spectrum visible to the human eye, ranging from approximately 400 nm (violet) to 800 nm (red-violet).
- **Absorption and Emission**: Spectroscopy investigates how substances absorb or emit energy in the form of light or electromagnetic waves.
- **Spectrum Analysis**: The process of breaking down light into its constituent wavelengths.

### Understanding Light

Light, in the context of spectroscopy, refers to electromagnetic radiation within the visible range of the human eye.

- **Wavelengths**: Visible light comprises wavelengths from about 400 nm (violet) to 800 nm (red).
- **Color Perception**: The color we perceive is a function of the wavelength of light.
- **Electromagnetic Spectrum**: Visible light is a part of a broader spectrum, including ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) light.

### Matter and Its Interaction with Light

Matter, whether in a gaseous, liquid, or solid state, interacts with radiation in various ways—absorption, transmission, or reflection.

### Oscillation in Light

- **Sinusoidal Oscillation**: Light waves exhibit a sinusoidal or harmonic oscillation.
- **Perception of Colors**: Our eyes perceive different wavelengths as different colors, with the combination of all wavelengths appearing white.

## Spectrometer Overview

A spectrometer is an instrument used to measure the spectrum of light.

### Components of a Spectrometer:

- **Light Source**: Provides the initial light for analysis.
- **Monochromator**: Separates light into its component wavelengths.
- **Sample Holder**: Holds the sample being analyzed.
- **Detector**: Captures and measures the light spectrum.

## Construction and Grating Order

- **Diffraction Grating**: A key component, often made from materials like a blank DVD.
- **Grating Order**: Refers to the directions in which light is diffracted.
